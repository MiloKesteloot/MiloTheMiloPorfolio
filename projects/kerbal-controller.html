                <h3>What Even Is This?</h3>
                <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/">Kerbal Space Program</a> is a spaceship flying game that I absolutely love.</p>
                <p>The only part about Kerbal Space Program (KSP) that I have to use my keyboard to play. It really takes the immersion out when I have to look for random keys to do actions in game.</p>
                <p>To fix this super pressing issue, I spent WAY too long creating this panel to play KSP with!</p>

                <h3>Overview</h3>
                <p><strong>Joysticks</strong><br>
                    The joysticks control the direction of the spaceship/aircraft! They have 3 degrees of rotation: forward-back, left-right, and rolling.</p>
                <p><strong>Rainbow Buttons</strong><br>
                    These are the action buttons! They each have their own affect in game; blue toggles the landing gear, white toggles the lights, red is abort flight</p>
                <h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
                <p>My controller uses an <a href="https://store-usa.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mega-2560-rev3">Arduino Mega</a> to connect with my computer thought USB.</p>
                <p>Our first attempt at this was essentially a USB keyboard. My computer and KSP would think that I was simply pressing keys on a keyboard (like "Space" or "Shift" or "Left Click"). However, we very quickly found a better solution: <a href="https://krpc.github.io/krpc/">kRPC</a>.</p>
                <p>kRPC is software that lets us interact directly with KSP. This means we can set values and trigger events through code.</p>
                <p>Through some very professional wiring...</p>
