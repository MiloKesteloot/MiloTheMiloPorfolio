In freshman year of high school I was, like everyone, addicted to my phone. My school had a rule against phones, so of course I turned to the next best thing. My calculator.

I quickly learned that I could code on my calculator. I could make games. I did nothing but that during every free second of my time in class.

This is a compilation of my favorite games I made on my calculator. (Some of them have been sped up as the calculator can be *slow*.)

I hope you enjoy!

This game is meant to be a cave-exploring, treasure-hunting game.

Then, of course, to wrap it all up, I made a menu to access all the games.

Coding in TI Basic was a challenge, but it was the fun kind of challenge.
